# DataQuest Solutions - Web3 Learning Platform

A decentralized learning platform built with React, TypeScript, and Ethereum smart contracts.

## Smart Contracts

The platform uses three main smart contracts:

1. `DataQuestToken.sol` - ERC20 token for platform transactions
2. `CourseNFT.sol` - NFT contract for course ownership
3. `LearningMarketplace.sol` - Marketplace for buying and selling courses

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development

- Frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Chakra UI
- Smart contracts are written in Solidity
- Web3 integration uses **Ethers.js v6**
- Contract types and factories are generated with **TypeChain**
- Deployment is configured for Vercel

## Frontend & Blockchain Interrelation

- The frontend uses Ethers.js v6 and contract factories/types generated by TypeChain for all blockchain interactions.
- Blockchain connection and contract instances are managed via a React context (`Web3Context`), making them available throughout the app.
- Custom React hooks (e.g., `useCourses`, `useToken`) interact with smart contracts using these factories and Ethers providers/signers.
- **Contract ABIs and types** are generated in the blockchain project (using Hardhat & TypeChain) and should be copied or linked into the frontend (`frontend/src/types/contracts/` and `frontend/src/types/factories/`).
- **Contract addresses** are loaded in the frontend from a config file or environment variable after deployment. Ensure you update the frontend with the latest deployed addresses after each contract deployment.

## Updating Contracts/Frontend Integration

1. Make changes to contracts in `blockchain/contracts/` and deploy using Hardhat.
2. Run TypeChain to generate updated types/factories.
3. Copy the generated types/factories and ABI files to `frontend/src/types/` as needed.
4. Update the frontend config/environment with the new contract addresses.
5. The frontend will now interact with the latest deployed contracts using the updated types and addresses.
